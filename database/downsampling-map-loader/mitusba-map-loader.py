# create new map table that holds the specific pixels that correspond to degree increments of phi_d, theta_h, and theta_d

# process: take the table that will hold the degeree increments of all the combinations of phi_h... 
# take each combo and put it through sgpm table and find the closest value -> 
# take that pixel location and AOI and AOC and store it in new map table
